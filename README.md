# laravel blog
a blog based site built using Laravel framework.


i created this project for learning purpose (also imaginators).


i used Bootstrap 4 for my front-end, and obviously laravel(5.6) framework.


i tried to implement most of the blog sites basic functionalities like:
    1. user authentication (registration/log in).
    2. user can add posts with title and body.
    3. user can choose a thumbnail picture for his post.
    4. user can comment on posts.
    5. **to be added** post tags.
    6. **to be added** posts pagination and sidebar to show most recent posts.
